# Simple_Chatty_Bot
Project: Simple Chatty Bot
https://hyperskill.org/projects/126/stages/672/implement

Description
At the final stage, you will improve your simple bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be a multiple-choice quiz about programming with any number of options. Your bot has to repeat the test until you answer correctly and congratulate you upon completion.

Objective
Your bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:

the line with the test should end with the question mark character;
an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)
If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:

Please, try again.
The program should stop on the correct answer and print Congratulations, have a nice day! at the end.

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the final version of your bot

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22: that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.

0!

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
